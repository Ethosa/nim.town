nim.town is a shared domain name, mainly geared toward nim developers

to use, add a record to the dnscontrol.js file and create a pull request.

a simple way to use this with static website (such as a github.io site) is as follows:
    - set-up a static website and add a CNAME file for the subdomain you want to use (foo.nim.town)
    - add a CNAME record to the dnscontrol.js file (CNAME("foo", "bar.github.io."))
it's as simple as that
